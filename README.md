Here’s a `README.md` file you can use for your GraphQL project. This includes a general description of GraphQL, the project setup, installation steps, and how to run it:

# Dummy GraphQL Server

This is a simple GraphQL server built using **Express.js**, **Apollo Server**, and **GraphQL**. It serves as a boilerplate or starter project for building GraphQL APIs with Node.js and MongoDB (via Mongoose).

---

## 📌 What is GraphQL?

**GraphQL** is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. It provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, giving clients the power to ask for exactly what they need — nothing more, nothing less.

Some benefits of GraphQL:
- Reduces over-fetching and under-fetching of data.
- Strongly typed schema.
- Single endpoint for all data requests.
- Introspective: Clients can query the API for details about the schema.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Node.js**
- **Express 5**
- **Apollo Server**
- **GraphQL**
- **Mongoose** (MongoDB ODM)
- **jsonwebtoken** (for auth)
- **graphql-scalars** (for custom scalar types)
- **nodemon** (for development)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dummy-graphql.git
cd dummy-graphql
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

> Note: Ensure you have Node.js (v16+) and npm installed.

### 3. Start the Server

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start using `nodemon` and run `index.js`. You should see a message indicating that the server is ready and listening on a port (default: `http://localhost:4000/graphql`).

---

## 🔌 GraphQL Endpoint

Once the server is running, visit:

```
http://localhost:4000/graphql
```

You can use tools like:

* [Apollo Sandbox](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox)
* [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
* [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
* [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql)
